# Veylo — Inspection Management SaaS

Universal platform for managing physical asset inspection workflows.
First vertical: **Vehicle Inspection** (leasing, car rental, fleet, insurance, dealers).

## Vision

Veylo is a SaaS reimplementation and generalization of a single-tenant vehicle inspection
system (Ayvens internal tool). Key insight: leasing companies build this in-house because
no good SaaS product exists. Veylo fills that gap — and beyond vehicles.

**Target markets (v1: vehicle vertical):**

- Leasing companies (return inspection)
- Car rental (post-rental inspection)
- Corporate fleet (scheduled inspections)
- Insurance (damage assessment)
- Car dealers (trade-in acceptance)

**Future verticals (v2+):**

- Real estate (apartment handover)
- Industrial equipment
- Aviation, marine

## Core Principle: Generic Core + Verticals

- **Core domain** is asset-agnostic
- **Vertical** = schema template + workflow preset + report template
- Organizations choose a vertical, then customize within it

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**

- **Language**: Go 1.23+
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **HTTP**: stdlib net/http + chi router
- **SQL**: sqlc (type-safe query generation)
- **Migrations**: golang-migrate
- **Auth**: JWT (access + refresh token rotation)
- **Config**: envconfig
- **Testing**: testify + testcontainers (integration)

**Frontend:**

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **UI library**: shadcn/ui built on **Base UI** (`@base-ui/react`) — NOT Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **State**: TanStack Query (server state), React state (local)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **HTTP client**: ky

**Important Base UI note:** Components like `Button` do NOT support the `asChild` prop (that's Radix-only).
To make a link look like a button, use `buttonVariants` directly on `<Link>`:

```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from '@/components/ui/button'
;<Link href="/foo" className={buttonVariants({ variant: 'default' })}>
  Label
</Link>
```

## DDD Rules

1. **Domain layer** — knows nothing about HTTP, DB, or any external concern
2. **Application layer** — orchestration only, zero business logic
3. **Infrastructure** — implements interfaces defined in domain
4. **Interface layer** — HTTP only: parse request, call use case, return response

Dependency direction: `interface → application → domain ← infrastructure`

## Go Conventions

- Always wrap errors: `fmt.Errorf("inspection.Create: %w", err)`
- Interfaces defined where consumed (domain), not where implemented
- No global variables
- Context is always the first argument
- Exported structs, mandatory `New...` constructor for entities
- Domain errors are typed: `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("inspection: not found")`

## Naming

- Entity: `Inspection`, `Asset`, `Finding`, `User`
- Repository interface: `InspectionRepository`
- Use case: `CreateInspectionUseCase`
- Handler: `InspectionHandler`
- DTO: `CreateInspectionRequest`, `InspectionResponse`

## Business Logic

### Inspection Status Flow

Two-level model:

**Level 1 — System stages (fixed, drives business logic):**

```
ENTRY → EVALUATION → REVIEW → FINAL
```

- `ENTRY`: findings/damages can be added
- `EVALUATION`: findings are being assessed (costs, severity)
- `REVIEW`: manager review before closing
- `FINAL`: triggers PDF report generation, webhooks, integrations

**Level 2 — Statuses (configurable per organization):**

```
Each org maps their own status names to system stages.

Example org A (leasing):
  NEW → DAMAGE_ENTERED → DAMAGE_EVALUATED → INSPECTED → COMPLETED
  (ENTRY)  (ENTRY)         (EVALUATION)      (REVIEW)    (FINAL)

Example org B (car rental):
  CREATED → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED → CLOSED
  (ENTRY)   (EVALUATION) (REVIEW)  (FINAL)
```

**Why this matters:** PDF generation, webhooks, and integrations key off system stages,
not status names. This is what makes veylo sellable to any company.

### Workflow Configuration

Each organization defines:

- Status names and descriptions
- Allowed transitions between statuses
- Which system stage each status maps to
- Who (by role) can perform each transition

### Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

Predefined roles per organization:

- **ADMIN**: full access, manage users, configure workflow
- **MANAGER**: create/manage inspections, approve transitions, view reports
- **INSPECTOR**: create inspections, enter findings/damages
- **EVALUATOR**: assess findings, set repair costs and severity

Permission checks happen at the **use case layer**, not HTTP layer.

### Multi-tenancy

Every resource is scoped to an `organization_id`.
Row-level isolation via `organization_id` on all tables.
JWT token carries `organization_id` and `user_id` — no extra DB lookup per request.

### Asset Model

`Asset` = the thing being inspected. Has a `type` and `vertical`-specific attributes.

Vehicle asset fields (v1):

- VIN (validated, 17 chars)
- License plate (sanitized, unique per org)
- Brand, model, body type, fuel type, transmission
- Odometer, color, engine power

Asset uniqueness is per organization (same VIN can exist in different orgs).

### Finding (Damage)

Universal damage/issue on an asset:

- Location (body area, coordinates on image)
- Type and description
- Images
- Assessment: severity (ACCEPTED / NOT_ACCEPTED / INSURANCE_EVENT)
- Repair method (REPAIR / REPLACEMENT / CLEANING / POLISHING / NO_ACTION)
- Cost breakdown (parts, labor, paint, etc.)
- Total cost (auto-calculated)

### Soft Delete

Inspections are never hard deleted. Soft delete with `deleted_at` timestamp.
Required for audit and compliance in leasing/insurance contexts.

### Audit Trail

Every status transition emits a domain event: `InspectionStatusChanged`.
Events stored in `inspection_events` table — immutable log of who did what when.

### Report Generation

PDF report generated when inspection reaches `FINAL` stage.
Report template is per vertical (vehicle template in v1).
Triggered by domain event, generated asynchronously.

### Integrations / Webhooks

When inspection reaches `FINAL` stage, fire configurable webhooks.
Replaces hardcoded `sentToAvyensAt` field from the original system.
Each organization configures their own webhook endpoints.

## Frontend Pages

### Roles & their primary tasks

| Role          | Daily job                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **INSPECTOR** | Opens app, creates inspection for a vehicle, walks around car, records findings + photos |
| **EVALUATOR** | Opens inspections in EVALUATION stage, assesses each finding (cost, repair method)       |
| **MANAGER**   | Reviews inspections in REVIEW stage, approves or returns                                 |
| **ADMIN**     | Configures system, manages team                                                          |

### Page map

**Public `(auth)`**

```
/                          Landing
/login                     Sign in
/signup                    Register (step 1)
/onboarding                Create workspace + invite team (steps 2–3)
/invite/[token]            Accept team invitation
```

**App `(app)` — authenticated**

```
/dashboard                 Role-aware task queue + overview stats

/inspections               List — filterable by status/stage/assignee
/inspections/new           Create inspection (select vehicle, enter contract details)
/inspections/[id]          Detail — findings list, status transitions, audit trail
                           EVALUATOR assesses findings here
                           MANAGER approves/returns here

/vehicles                  Vehicle registry
/vehicles/new              Add vehicle
/vehicles/[id]             Vehicle detail + inspection history

/team                      Team members list + invite (ADMIN/MANAGER)

/settings/workflow         Configure statuses & transitions — core differentiator
/settings                  Organization info
```

### Priority order (by business value)

```
1. /inspections + /inspections/[id]     core loop
2. /inspections/new + /vehicles/new     data entry
3. /dashboard                           role-aware queue
4. /settings/workflow                   unique competitive advantage
5. /team                                required for multi-user orgs
6. /vehicles                            vehicle registry
```

### Key design decisions

- **Findings live inside `/inspections/[id]`**, not on a separate page. The inspector adds them inline; the evaluator assesses them inline.
- **`/dashboard` is role-aware** — INSPECTOR sees their queue, EVALUATOR sees findings to assess, MANAGER sees inspections to approve. Not just generic stats.
- **`/settings/workflow`** is what gets sold to leasing companies. Must be polished.
- Vehicle creation can happen inline during `/inspections/new` (quick-add) without leaving the flow.

## Security

### Refresh Token Rotation

- Access token: short-lived (15 min)
- Refresh token: long-lived (7 days), stored hashed in DB
- Every refresh → old token invalidated, new token issued
- Prevents token replay attacks

## Testing Strategy

- **Domain**: pure unit tests, no dependencies
- **Application**: unit tests with mocked repositories
- **Infrastructure**: integration tests with testcontainers (real PostgreSQL)
- **HTTP**: handler tests with httptest

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Single-tenant, no organizationId | Multi-tenant, organizationId on all entities   |
| Statuses hardcoded in code       | Configurable per organization                  |
| Hardcoded `sentToAvyensAt` field | Generic webhook/integration layer              |
| HTTP exceptions in domain layer  | Typed domain errors                            |
| Hard delete                      | Soft delete with audit trail                   |
| No token rotation                | Refresh token rotation                         |
| Ayvens-specific field names      | Generic, vertical-agnostic naming              |
| Vehicle only                     | Generic asset model, vehicle is first vertical |
| Single company forever           | Sold to any fleet/leasing/rental company       |
